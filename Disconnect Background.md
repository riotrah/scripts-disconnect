General Flow of Dialog:
======================

> We aim to explore varying peaks and valleys of conversational energy

Starts with L poking fun at R's attempt at deep pretension. "One year on and you're the same person eh?"

R feigns offense. Starts talking about the performativity of social gatherings. Performatively explains how everyone is showing face. Goes on for quite a bit. L doesn't take to it. L just doesn't think that's the case and accuses R of projecting. R is actually offended now - or at least miffed that L didn't validate them. Medium energy and uncooperative.

R asks L about L's love life so far. L's been doing well with A. A is supportive and such. R asks what they do for fun and whatnot. L says they mostly go on walks and chill in a low energy settings more. R offhandedly calls A a lame homebody. A actually responds from L's phone. R realizes A is an AI and is outraged that L had A listen to the conversation. L shuts off A but is hurt about R's outrage. L and R start fighting about R's paranoia and emotional insecurity while R lobbies deep cutting insults about L's dependence on others and lower self esteem and their falsely obtained sense of security. High energy and uncooperative

L concedes R's attacks but calls out R for always being a downer fuck. The fight deescalates. In the lull after, L asks R what their love life has been like. R reveals they broke up with their recent partner, P, due to jealousy of P's artistic successes and sabotaged an opportunity of P's. P found out and broke up. R admits they're still a piece of shit. Low energy and cooperative.
