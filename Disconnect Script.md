## Performativity
> Things start jovial and theatrical. L and R are on a couple of beers, nursing another. They recently left their reunion group. They're climbing onto parts of L's roof. 

- L: Here, I want you to check this part out!
	- *both climb ledge to roof section, bagged beers in hand*
- R: This is awesome. Got a nice dingy feel to it.
- L: Right? Gotta make up for the rent somehow. Come on.
	- *L leads R to spot, sits upon it. R follows suite*
- L: Hey- can I tell you something?
- R: Yeah-
	- *(laughing)*
- L: You're so full of shit. *Please* tell me you're not still like this around other people.
- R: Full of shit? That's quite the accusation
	- *(still laughing)*
- L: Ugh you're trying *so* hard to be all, like, brooding and, artsy, and shit. 
	- *(eye roll)*
- L: Dude. You know they all, like, know who you are, right?
	- *(feigning indignance)*
- R: Well *excuse* you. First of all, fuck you.
	- *(laughter from L)*
- R: I may be full of shit but so is everyone else. So *perhaps* I may not have changed in that respect. 
	- *(gets up to face L)*
- R: But all the world's a stage, right?-
- L: Oh no not this shit.
- R: No, no, listen: what difference does it make? Why not live it up a little and have a little fun? I'm probably not gonna see these bozos again, so who gives an absolute damn if I alienate *or* impress them? 
- L: Well, clearly you give an "absolute" damn about these bozos.
- R: Yes, yes I do. I didn't think I'd get crucified for it. Anyways, I wasn't lying about anything back there. I'll concede your charges of performativity but I'm a man of my word.
- L: Bullshit. You were yapping on and on about their "normie" beer. You don't even drink beer. You're literally sipping a Natty light right now.
- R: Well, that much is true. It appears you still get off on trying to get a rise out of people.
- L: No, just you, but yes! I'm still a piece of shit! But also, before we drop this, I think it's important to point out that you're totally just projecting. I don't think anyone else at that table was trying as hard as you were.
- R: Fuck that. You only saw through my... charade because you know me as well as you do. 
	*(overlapped)*:
- L: Because I know you better than them yeah yeah. I'm still saying you're pretentious as ever. Anyways how's-
- R: Hey now, I'm not dropping this. The difference between... reunions, first dates, interviews, is only of degree: no one's "themselves" except around their like 3 best friends. You perform too, you just haven't ever listened to yourself speak.
	*(L knocks over beer as they say this)*
- L: Dude, that's just straight up not true.
	*(R grabs the beer)*
- R: Hey watch out!
	*(takes a sip before handing it back w/ shit-eating grin)*
	*(L punches R in arms)*

## Moms
> They're at a different part of the roof. They're talking about L's mom.

- L: You know, I like never learned how to be nice to my mom the way you were. She really liked you but that's probably because you constantly validated the shit out of her.
- R: I mean, I'm just a nice person. Perhaps you could learn a thing or two from me.
- L: You? You're the fucking grinch, dude, with literally anyone else, including me. And your own mom. But anyways, yeah she's doing ok despite her daughter never picking up.
- R: Ah the mommy issues have yet to be resolved eh?
- L: Not in the year since I heard your last mommy issue joke, no.
- R: How's the card making venture?
- L: Tanked. She's running a bakery now though. Dad's ok footing the bill, as long as she's not home.
	- *(Overlapping)*
- R: As long as she's not bored or depressed.
- L: Yeah. That. She's actually doing well. Her bubbliness comes out better baking than in her christmas greetings I guess. She keeps trying to get me to work there when I visit but fuck that.
- R: Oh wait I left my beer back there.
- L: Hey uh, Kim told me about your Mom.
- R: Yeah
- L: Yeah. I'm sorry. I wish I was there around then.
- R: No it's ok. It's all good. She was honestly doing Ok. By the end she had, ya know, accepted everything, and made her amends, and she was surrounded by people who loved her and all her friends. My dad came down and stayed with her and for a while it was the closest we'd been as a family for a while. She wasn't exactly looking forward to dying but she wasn't heartbroken. I guess that's the sort of thing you feel when you're first diagnosed I suppose. After a few months it's a little easier to accept things. Maybe by the end you start enjoying

## Indie rock festival

- R: Remember how we'd talked about making the trip to Penn to see that Plumbum, Kissers and Rosemary Hearse festival?
- L: Haha yeah that shit, did you end up going?
- R: Yes I did end up going to that shit, thank you very much.
- L: Awesome. I mean I can just like tell you now I was never actually gonna go but hey I'm glad you saw them.
- R: That's not quite the reaction I was expecting.
- L: Oh right you want me to kiss your feet and apologize for not liking your hipster indie music enough to go to a 6 hour concert with you, right?
- R: Yes I'd like that but since I won't get it your edginess will suffice. Anyways I made the trip-
- L: By yourself?
- R: Yes by myself. And so I went right. It's absolutely pouring, and, my car- I rented this hourly thing- is the most hidious shit and has absolutely no space.and saw them and it was fucking excellent.
- L: That's awesome!
- R: Yeah and you won't believe who opened for Plumbum.
	- *(attempted dramatic pause)*
- R: Fucking Dirty Socks.
- L: Oh shit! I haven't even seen them! Dude how were they!?
- R: Not as good as Plumbum, but the singer dude crowd surfed for like 10 minutes.
- L: Yeah?
- R: He yelled something about catharsis and jumped off at the end of *You've Got a Thang Goin On*. The dude 

## Automation

- R: You're gonna be personally responsible for the downfall of human society.
- L: I wish. If I had that much influence I'd probably be paid more.
- R: You're paid pretty well.
- L: That's true. Anyways, we're at the point of no return, dude. It doesn't matter what one company or engineer does, most repetitive jobs are going to be automated. The question is of time.
- R: But what are people supposed to do? What's gonna happen?
- L: I can't tell you that and I don't think anyone can. Nothing has changed since the last time we had this exact conversation. You're probably safe dude, even if we have AIs that can generate "art" people are unlikely to trust or give value to them.
- R: It's not just me. People like you don't have to worry about this stuff but there are so many people out there who are gonna get fucked-
- L: People like me? Dude when was the last time you read the news? Engineers are losing jobs left and right to outsourcing and machine learning. The number of engineers and CS grads is fucking exploding dude. I have to prove myself at work every day so I don't get replaced by every fucking teenager who walks in with an online diploma asking for half my pay. You don't have to deal with that. You've already established yourself. No AI is going to steal your job or any of your friends-
- R: Look, I'm sorry. You're right, you're right. I don't know about the climate of your industry. I'm just saying that it's not about me, its about the other people in the world, in this country.
- L: Ok, fine. It'll be tough. Our dumbass government is completely ill-prepared for this collosal industrial revolution that's going to do who knows what to our economy. I really don't think it's fair that you're pinning it on me.


	R

What the fuck? You've had your fucking robot lover listen in on our conversation? 

	L

I didn't have him listen it's just always-

	R

Always on? Of course you keep it always right by your ear yeah? Does it get jealous too? You ever fuck her, you robotic fuck, do you know what that feels like? Do you even know what it feels like to- to know that I did? 

- C: This isn't nec-

	L

R, what the fuck are you doing? Stop.

	L turns off ai.
	L

He's muted now. What is your problem? Are you so threatened by some fucking code?

	R

You replaced me with some fucking code?

	L

Replaced you? 

	L sighs

Of course.

	R

No don't give me that of course shit. I'm not jealous. I just think it's pathetic. That you'd go from being with real flesh, blood, tears- 

	L

You're not jealous? You just tried to outman an AI. Dude, you're a trope.

	R

No. I'm not. But you know why you are? You're so- so desperate for validation and this bullshit self security- this fucking bubble of-

	L

Before you give me your fucking spiel about weakness and artificial validation- about buying a worshipper - yeah right? - so- so I feel good about myself - which I'm honestly not gonna lie is a *part* of why I'm dating C-

	R

You're not *dating*-

	L

Dude save it. I have a question for you: why does it bother you so much? Why does it-

	R

It doesn-

	L

It absolutely does, dude. You were yelling at me like a second ago for doing something with my life that has nothing to do with you. You haven't seen me in a year and you're getting your balls twisted over who I'm dating, dude? What- you're paranoid about being listened in on, yeah?

	R

Yes th-

	L

Shut up. You know full fucking well all the other shit on my phone is listening anyways, and yours too. No, you're very specifically scared about something else

	R

I'm not scared. This isn't about being scared. You don't have to project - not everyone goes around being scared of being alone in the big bad wo-

	L

Oh my god you're impossible. Just because you're some cynical performative pseudo artistic fuck doesn't mean that I'm projecting when I'm- ugh - you're so painfully ironically fucking oblivious how much *you're* projecting... what's your problem with C?

	R

I... think it's pathetic that you just go around inflating your ego by- by having this programmed *thing* just whisper how great you are into your ear all the time. It's like some... middle aged fuck paying prostitutes to- to listen to his shitty marriage problems.

	L

Dude, what the fuck are you on about?

	R

You said so yourself: you want to feel good about yourself-

	L

Yes! Like everyone else, and?

	R

Debatable- but you're avoiding the challenges of a real person - a real human who's not always gonna treat you the way you think you want-

	L

You mean an asshole, you mean like you

	R

No I don't. They don't have to be an asshole to challenge you. And you know that, which is what makes this kind of... disgusting

*Disgusting*?

	R

Yes. You never challenge yourself, L. You- you always like tiptoe through your life. You project this... aggressive confidence but you're really just so insecure.

	L

Dude. What is wrong with you? How do you get off on saying shit like this? Who the fuck do you think you are? 

	L laughs during next line

No, seriously. You heard literally a sentence from my boyfriend and suddenly that opened up your fucking soap box- what, you're my Dad now? You're gonna pretend this has nothing to do with your constant tragedy, your self-pity? I just don't understand what you're so afraid of. Being replaced? Becoming obsolete? Being spied on? Being oh so more obviously imperfect?

	R

Yes. It's all of those fucking things. If you knew, you didn't have to ask.

	L

No, you'd never admit to anything if I didn't. You- you complain and you- you perform vulnerability. But I've never seen you cry out of a sadness that wasn't this theater of self loathing as if anyone was a fucking paid patron your bullshit mime show. And maybe the fucking AIs I create, if I could, I'd - I'd program the whole fucking gamut of human emotions, ok, but I'd be sure as hell to make sure no AI of mine fucking cries themselves to sleep feeling vindictive at the whole fucking world because they have no outlet for their emotions beyond some fucking lowest common denominator stock photography and their endless shopping list of flaws they seek out in everyone else around them and their fucking cliche ass mommy issues and-

	R

Stop it. You... don't... get to talk to me that way.

	L

Yeah I... probably don't. But you pick these fights better than anyone else does. I guess you know how to bring the worst out of people huh?

	R

Thanks, that's... what I aspire to. That was a lot, L.

	L sighs
	L

Yeah. You're - you're right. I'm sorry.

	R

Yeah I'm sorry- I - uh - yeah.

	L

Yeah, we had a lot of fucking issues.

	R

I don't want to admit that everything I was saying was... well- you summed it up, I guess. But I'd be lying if I told you it... hurt for any reason other than it being, well... a, uh, pretty fucking accurate.

	L

Yeah- no I uh... yeah I'm sorry. I got just as defensive, maybe more so, than you did and I just mouthed off some stuff I never really had the ovaries to say I guess.

	R

Well, looks like the AI validation is working.

	L laughs

	L

No shame here, if it works. It works. I guess I should have seen this coming. I guess the most fucked up thing is that I know - knew - exactly the kind of person you are. And I knew it then and I- I um- I never really considered that- these parts of your personality that I knew needed to be taken care of and paid attention to and I didn't

	R

I don't like you talking about me like I'm a child

	L

I know you don't

	R

But... that's your point. I'm a lot more sensitive than I let on. But I suppose I do let it on and I'm not really very good at hiding it.

	L

Yeah. And I was never good at not taking everything you said personally-

	R

I'm sorry I-

	L

I know I know. Part of what's nice about time, is that even though I had too much ego and was probably as sensitive as you were, the thing about time is that it allows me to-to retroactively know better and know that it was just you and I being big fucking babies. And I don't feel that same way when you try to put me down anymore-

	R

L I don't think that's a fair-

	L

R, you know... what you do. It's just what you do. I'm not saying you haven't stopped doing it or that you won't but from tonight it seems like there's at least a part of you still there.

	R

L I feel like you're really painting me in this unfair way like I'm some big fucking asshole and I already feel that way enough right now, I don't need you to keep reminding me. I get that I'm being defensive but I'm being attacked so what else would I do?

	L

No, that's understandable. My point is that I was trying to bring you down too. And I know you knew that. I totally on purpose just ignored your feelings and your fucking obvious calls for help- attention- whatever. And I mean here I am

	R

With your scripted lil attention bot, right.

	L

Yeah, my fucking attention bot. I was never good at that- letting people get what they want- being the bigger person or whatever. I'm... sorry I couldn't be better even when I could have been.

	R

It's just funny that you're apologizing to me, when I was clearly the bigger asshole. I get that you were the, like, meta asshole or whatever, knowing better and all that but that went my way too. I've known I was a piece of shit my whole life or at least since my mom-

	L

Yeah

	R

Or honestly probably before that too. I'm not like saying I'm destined to be an asshole I mean I just... I guess, I don't know

	L

No dude I get it.
